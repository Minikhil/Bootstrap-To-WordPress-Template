		<h2>Providers & Referrals for International Students</h2>
		<h3>Providers</h3>
		<p>
		All care (unless it is a life-threatening emergency) should begin at the Health Services in Michael Hall. Call them at 829-3316 to make an appointment. There is also a lab and a pharmacy operated by Sub Board One, Inc. in the same building, taking care of most health care needs in one stop. If you have an emergency and are off campus, dial 911. If you are on campus and have an emergency, call 2222. Campus Security will bring emergency medical personnel to your location. Dependents are NOT eligible for services at the Student Health Center unless they are also enrolled as students. Scholars may, however, consult with Student Health Center Staff regarding referrals to health care providers for their families.</p>

		<h3>Referrals</h3>

		You will have to pay a $50 deductible of your own money for each injury or illness you have treated without a referral from Health Services.  Insurance benefits are very limited in your home country. If you go for medical treatment off campus and it is not an emergency, you will pay the $50 deductible.  If Health Services is closed, and it is not an emergency, you can wait until they open or call the on-call medical provider for medical advice over the phone. If it is a medical emergency, you can visit any medical facility.
