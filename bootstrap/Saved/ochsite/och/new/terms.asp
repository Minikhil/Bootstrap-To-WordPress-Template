<h2>What is a Certificate of Occupancy?</h2>
A Certificate of Occupancy is a document that is issued by your local municipality (village, town, city, etc.) indicating that the property has been inspected by a Licensed Building Inspector (usually from the Department of Buildings or Licenses and Inspection) and meets the requirements for habitation based on the buildings classification.
For many municipalities this is a requirement before any structure may be inhabited by tenants and/or businesses. Several municipalities call the Certificate of Occupancy by a different name; such as a Certificate of Compliance or a Certificate of Habitation. Not all municipalities require a certificate, and some do not offer certificates to certain classifications of property.
Because a municipality does not require an inspection, does not mean that the property cannot be inspected. Contact your local municipality and ask if they provide safety/building inspections for your property.
