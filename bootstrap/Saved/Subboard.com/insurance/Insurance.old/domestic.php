            <h1>University Policy</h1>
            <strong>The University requires all students taking 12 credits undergraduate or 9 hours graduate study to have adequate health insurance coverage.</strong> All students covered under this university policy will automatically be charged for the University plan on the first qualifying tuition bill for the semester. All others who wish to enroll may do so by <strong><a href="domestic_enroll.php">clicking here</a></strong>. Students who have adequate private coverage may waive the plan by providing proof of comparable coverage and submitting an on-line waiver by the due date of their tuition bill for the semester. Comparable coverage must be in effect on or before the first day of classes.<br /><br />
