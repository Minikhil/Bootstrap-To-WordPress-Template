            <h1>Preferred Providers for Domestic Students</h1>
            Aetna Student Health has arranged for you to access a Preferred Provider Network. Acute care facilities and mental health networks are available nationally if you require hospitalization outside the immediate area of the University at Buffalo campus.<br /><br />
            To maximize your savings and reduce your out-of-pocket expenses, select a Preferred Provider*. It is to your advantage to use a Preferred Provider because savings may be achieved from the Negotiated Charges these providers have agreed to accept as payment for their services. A complete listing of participating providers is available by contacting Aetna Student Health at (800) 954-5793. You can also use Aetna's online DocFindÂ® service located at <a href="http://www.aetnastudenthealth.com" target="_blank">www.aetnastudenthealth.com</a>. Click on "Find Your School" and enter 100116 as your Policy Number.
