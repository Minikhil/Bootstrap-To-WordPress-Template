<h3>Apartment Scam Warning</h3>

<h4>Please read this apartment scam warning!</h4>

<p>Most scams involve one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Inquiry from someone far away, often in another country</li>
	<li>Western Union, Money Gram, cashier's check, money order, shipping, escrow service, or a guarantee</li>
	<li>Inability or refusal to meet face-to-face before consummating transaction</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example of a common Scam at OCH</h4>
<ul>
	<li>You receive an email offering to rent your apartment, sight unseen.</li>
	<li>Cashier's check is offered for your sale item, as a deposit for an apartment, or for just about anything else of value.</li>
	<li>Value of cashier's check often far exceeds your item - scammer offers to trust you, and asks you to wire the balance via money transfer service</li>
	<li>Banks will often cash these fake checks <strong>and then hold you responsible when the check fails to clear</strong>, including criminal prosecution in some cases!</li>
	<li>Scam often involves a third party (shipping agent, business associate owing buyer money, etc)</li>
</ul>
