                <h5 style="text-align:left; "> What to do if you are sexually assaulted</h5>
                <ul  style="text-align: left">
                  <li>Get to a safe place.</li>
                  <li> <a href="http://crisisservices.org/link2.html ">Call Crisis Services</a>’ 24-hour support at 834-3131 (Erie County’s Rape Crisis Center). Service is free and confidential.</li>
                  <li> Get to a hospital.</li>
                  <li>Call someone you trust.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5 style="text-align:left; "> Medical Attention</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li style="text-align: left;">To preserve the best evidence, try not to bathe, douche, comb your hair, change clothing, or disturb the area in which the crime occurred.
                    If you do do these things medical evidence can still be preserved so it is still recommended to go to the hospital.
                  </li>
                  <li style="text-align: left;">
                    Seek medical attention at your local Emergency Room. University Police can arrange for transportation if you need it.
                  </li>
                  <li style="text-align: left;">Crisis Services can provide an advocate to meet you at the hospital, and provide support, assistance, and make sure you know your rights and your options.</li>
                  <li style="text-align: left;">Even if you have no physical injuries, it is important to determine the risk of STIs and pregnancy.</li>
                  <li style="text-align: left;">There is a small window of time to receive medication to prevent HIV, STIs, and pregnancy as well as a Code-R Kit, so getting to a hospital after an assault is important.</li>
                  <li style="text-align: left;">It is your choice to preserve forensic evidence at the hospital, with a trained SANE (Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner) nurse who will conduct a rape kit exam. You can collect the evidence at the hospital and decide later to press charges or not.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5 style="text-align:left; ">Options for Reporting a Sexual Assault </h5>
                <ul>
                  <li style="text-align: left;">
                    It is your choice to file a police report or not.
                  </li>
                  <li style="text-align: left;"> You can file a report and decide later to press charges or not. NY State lifted the statute of limitations for all sexual crimes taking place on or after June 23rd 2006.
                  </li>
                  <li style="text-align: left;"> You can file the report with UB police, or with the jurisdiction that the assault happened in.</li>
                  <li style="text-align: left;"> Call Crisis Services if you would like an advocate to be with you. They will explain your options and how the process works.</li>
                  <li style="text-align: left;"> While UB encourages students to report any and all assaults, reporting an assault does not mean that you must prosecute.</li>
                  <li style="text-align: left;">  You can file a direct report, a proxy report, or a third party report. Information about reporting through UB Police is located here.</li>
                  <li style="text-align: left;">  Female officers are available upon request.</li>
                </ul>

                  <li style="text-align: left;">To have all incident and medical records kept strictly confidential.</li>
                  <li style="text-align: left;">To be treated without prejudice regarding race, class, lifestyle, sexual orientation, gender, age, occupation, and/or religious beliefs.</li>
                  <li style="text-align: left;">To be made aware of and receive medical treatment, psychological support, and legal counseling.</li>
                  <li style="text-align: left;">To prosecute or not to prosecute.</li>
                  <li style="text-align: left;">To answer only those questions that are relevant to the crime.</li>
                  <li style="text-align: left;">To have an advocate present with you at the hospital, police station, and court proceedings.</li>

                <h5 style="text-align: left;">What it is?</h5>
                <p style="text-align: left;">
                  No Woman Left Behind (NWLB) is a bystander intervention program created by women for women and the men who care about them. It was established to educate communities about sexual assault and to create a culture that does not wait for someone else to take action. In addition to serving as a public awareness campaign this program includes,
                  curriculum based educational initiatives for college
                  students as well as functioning NWLB chapters located on campuses throughout the country.
                </p>
                <h5 style="text-align: left;">History</h5>
                <p style="text-align: left;">
                  The idea for No Woman Left Behind (NWLB) came from students at Sacramento State University in the summer of 2007 after reading about the De Anza college rape case. Several members of the De Anza college baseball team allegedly assaulted a young girl at a party. No one at the party of over 50 people offered to help until three women from the De Anza soccer team intervened, fought off the players, and brought the girl to the hospital for treatment. Later, one woman at the party told a reporter
                  that she saw ten people cheering baseball players who were engaging in sex with the girl.
                  She did not interfere because “I didn’t think of it as a rape situation.”
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">
                  No Woman Left Behind was inspired by Lauren Bryeans, April Grolle and Lauren Chief Elk, members of the women’s soccer team
                  at De Anza College in Cupertino, California. We would also like to acknowledge the survivor of the sexual assault.
                  Her courage is truly inspiring. Her strength, as well as the strength of all sexual assault survivors is remarkable.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">
                  In the spring of 2010 One Student (formerly Unite for Change) became the official headquarters for the No Woman Left Behind Campaign.
                  One Student is privileged to be able to give this incredible campaign a home within our organization and
                  honored to have the opportunity to continue to spread the message of courage and sisterhood that was inspired by four young women.
