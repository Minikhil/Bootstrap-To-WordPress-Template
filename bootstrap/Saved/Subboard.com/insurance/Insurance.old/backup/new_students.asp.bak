<h3><strong>Important Information</strong></h3>
 
<p>The University at Buffalo requires all qualifying full-time domestic students and all international exchange students to carry comparable medical insurance coverage for the duration of their academic registration at UB.  All qualifying domestic students (defined as undergraduates with 12 credit hours or more and graduate/professional students with 9 credit hours or more) and all international students (1 credit hour or more) will be automatically charged for the UB Student Medical Insurance premium to their tuition bill and enrolled in the program.  Domestic students are insured through AETNA Student Health and International students through HTH Worldwide Insurance Services.</p>
