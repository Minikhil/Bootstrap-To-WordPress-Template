			<h2>International Students</h2>
			<h3>University Policy</h3>
			<p><strong>SUNY requires all international students &amp; scholars to carry adequate medical coverage.</strong> All students covered under this university policy will automatically be charged for the University plan on the first qualifying tuition bill for the semester. All others who wish to enroll may do so by <a href='international_enroll.asp'> clicking here</a>. Students who have adequate private coverage may waive the plan by providing proof of comparable coverage and submitting a waiver by the due date of their tuition bill for the semester. Comparable coverage must be in effect on or before the first day of classes.</p>
