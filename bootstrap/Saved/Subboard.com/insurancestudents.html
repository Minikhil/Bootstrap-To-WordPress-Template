                        <h3>International Students</h3>
                        <p>The international insurance is contracted by SUNY through GeoBlue. International students are automatically billed and enrolled each semester that they are registered, unless an approved waiver is on file. The coverage dates are as follows:
                            <br>Fall: August 15 - January 14
                            <br>Spring: January 15 - August 14
                            <br>Summer-only: May 15 - August 14

                        <br>
                        <h3>International Scholars</h3>
                        <p>All international scholars have an insurance required as defined by SUNY and visa requirements. International scholars who wish to purchase the GeoBlue insurance must first visit University at Buffalo Immigration Services (UBIS--110 Cooke Hall) to get necessary paperwork. After visiting UBIS, you would want to complete an enrollment form and return to <strong>Student Medical Insurance Office to make payment.</strong><br><br> If you have your own private insurance and wish to complete a waiver, click here.<br><br>If you have an approved waiver on file and you solely need to purchase the Medical Evacuation and Repatriation coverage, click here.

                        <br>
                        <h3>OPT</h3>
                        <p>Graduating students going on OPT have the ability to continue purchasing the GeoBlue insurance for the duration of their OPT status. Deadlines apply. To enroll, we need a completed enrollment form, payment, and a copy of your EAD card (once you receive it) Click here to access the enrollment form.</p>

                        <br>
                        <h3>Providers</h3>
                        <p>If you are in the Buffalo area, your first step in seeking medical care should be to the Student Health Center, located on South Campus in Michael Hall. If you need to receive specialized care off-campus, you will receive a referral from the Student Health Center. Be sure to follow the steps on the GeoBlue form to enter the referral code into the website, as this will waive the $50 deductible you would normally be charged.
                            <br><br>If you are unable to get to the Student Health Center, or if you are referred to a doctor off-campus, you would login to your GeoBlue account to search for providers who accept your insurance. Once logged in, click on the “Tools &amp; Services” tab. From there, you can search for providers within and outside of the United States, Search through the doctors available to you. Once you find one you are comfortable with, you would contact that doctor’s office to set up an appointment. Be sure to submit your referral BEFORE going to that off-campus visit. You will also need to take your insurance ID card with you to any provider off-campus, to avoid any delay in the payment of your claims.</p>

                    <p><strong>RETURN TO STUDY:</strong>If you return to UB as a full-time student after your Study Abroad, you will be charged for the UB Domestic Student Medical Insurance in the semester you return. If you do not want that coverage, you must complete a Domestic Waiver when you return to UB.<br><br>
                        <h3>Medical Evacuation and Repatriation Coverage</h3>
                        <p>Medical evacuation benefits provide for the arrangement and payment of medical and travel expenses to the nearest appropriate facility, or return home, when seriously ill or injured. Repatriation benefits cover expenses related to the preparation and return of remains to the family in the event of death abroad. It is mandatory for all Study Abroad participants to carry medical evacuation and repatriation coverage. Medical Evacuation and Repatriation coverage is already included as a benefit if you purchase the full SUNY international insurance plan.
