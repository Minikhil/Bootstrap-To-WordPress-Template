			<h3>Preferred Provider Network</h3>
			<p>Aetna Student Health has arranged for you to access a Preferred Provider Network. Acute care facilities and mental health networks are available nationally if you require hospitalization outside the immediate area of the University at Buffalo campus.</p>
			<p>To maximize your savings and reduce your out-of-pocket expenses, select a Preferred Provider*. It is to your advantage to use a Preferred Provider because savings may be achieved from the Negotiated Charges these providers have agreed to accept as payment for their services. A complete listing of participating providers is available by contacting Aetna Student Health at (800) 954-5793. You can also use Aetna's online DocFind&reg; service located at <a href='www.aetnastudenthealth.com'>www.aetnastudenthealth.com</a>.
