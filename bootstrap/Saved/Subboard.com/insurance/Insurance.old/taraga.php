            <h2>Teaching, Research, & Graduate Assistants Waiver</h2>
            Teaching and graduate assistants are eligible for <a href="http://hr.buffalo.edu/gseu" target="_blank">NYSHIP</a>; research assistants are eligible for <a href="http://hr.buffalo.edu/rfgrads" target="_blank">POMCO</a>. You are automatically enrolled in the student health insurance until you attend your assistantship orientation. At that time there will be a departmental transmission which will remove the student health insurance fee from your student account.<br /><br />
            
            If you are a teaching, research, or graduate assistant with <strong>your own private health insurance</strong>, please follow the waiver process for domestic or international students.
