<h2>SBI Legal Assistance Roommate Tips</h2>
<strong>Roommate Tip 1:</strong> Choose your roommates wisely: by signing your name to a lease, you may become liable/responsible for the actions of your roommates both criminally and with the University (<a href="http://www.ub-judiciary.buffalo.edu/swj.shtml" target="_blank">Student-Wide Judiciary</a>).
<br /><br />
<strong>Roommate Tip 2:</strong> Some leases have a "joint and several liability" clause meaning the entire amount of rent is due each month no matter what (e.g., your roommate moves out or can't pay, you will be held responsible). Make sure you find out before signing your lease and decide whether or not this is acceptable to you.<br /><br />

<h3>"Are Roommates a Hazard?" - Legal Concerns (Rent Guidelines Board)</h3>
In today's tight housing market one way to make your income meet the rent is to have a roommate.
<br /><br />
If you are the only person who has signed the lease, in addition to your immediate family, state law allows you to have one roommate (i.e. an occupant of the apartment who has not signed the lease). Your roommate's dependent children are also permitted.
<br /><br />
Any lease provisions disallowing a roommate (and dependent children) are illegal. If your lease originally had two or more tenants you may have an additional roommate or roommates provided that the total number of tenants and occupants (excluding occupant's dependent children) does not exceed the number of tenants on the original lease. For example, if three tenants signed the original lease and one moves out, you may have a roommate to replace the departed tenant.
<br /><br />
Check your roommate's background thoroughly. If you don't get along, and your roommate refuses to leave, you do have the right to evict your roommate. However, if the roommate refuses to leave, the ensuing eviction process could be both painful and expensive. Remember, until the eviction process is complete you may have to live with this person.
<br /><br />
If you join someone as a roommate (i.e. your name isn't on the lease) another set of problems can crop up. In most instances, if your roommate (the leaseholder) leaves, you have no right to keep the apartment. The primary tenant might also decide to temporarily sublet to someone, in which case you will suddenly have a new house-mate not of your choosing.
<br /><br />
<em>What precautions can you take?</em><br />
If you are the leaseholder, be careful about choosing a roommate. If you join someone as a "roommate," try to find out as much as possible about the primary tenants' plans. Try to "get on the lease" if possible. If this isn't possible, your rights are very limited and your ability to stay in the apartment may be cut short at any time.
<br /><br />
<em>Can I get my unpleasant roommate's name off the lease we both signed?</em><br />
If your roommate is named on the lease, s/he is technically a co-tenant, and has the same rights as you do to the apartment.
